1.   Introduction

   Content delivery over HTTPS using one or more CDNs along the path
   requires credential management.  This specifically applies when an
   entity delegates delivery of encrypted content to another trusted
   entity.

   [RFC9115] defines a mechanism where an upstream entity, that is,
   holder of a X.509 certificate can give a temporary delegated
   authority, via issuing a certificate to one or more downstream
   entities for the purposes of delivering content on its behalf.
   Furthermore, the upstream entity has the ability to extend the
   duration of the certificate automatically and iteratively until it
   allows the last renewal to end and therefore terminate the use of
   certificate authority to the downstream entity.

   More specifically, [RFC9115] defines a process where the upstream
   Content Delivery Network (uCDN), the holder of the domain, generates
   on-demand a X.509 certificate for the downstream CDN (dCDN).  The
   certificate generation process ensures that the certified public key
   corresponds to a private key controlled by the downstream CDN.
   [RFC9115] follows [RFC8739] for Short-Term, Automatically Renewed
   Certificate (STAR) in the Automated Certificate Management
   Environment (ACME).

   This document defines CDNI Metadata to make use of HTTPS delegation
   between an upstream CDN (uCDN) and a downstream CDN (dCDN) based on
   mechanism specified in [RFC9115].  Furthermore, it includes a
   proposal of IANA registry to enable adding of delegation methods.

   Section 1.1 defines terminology used in this document.  Section 2
   presents delegation metadata for the FCI interface.  Section 4
   addresses the metadata for handling HTTPS delegation with the
   Metadata Interface.  Section 5 addresses IANA registry for delegation
   methods.  Section 6 covers the security considerations.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from CDNI framework documents such as:
   CDNI framework document [RFC7336], CDNI requirements [RFC7337] and
   CDNI interface specifications documents: CDNI Metadata interface
   [RFC8006] and CDNI Footprint and capabilities [RFC8008].

2.  Delegation metadata for CDNI FCI

   The Footprint and Capabilities interface as defined in [RFC8008],
   allows a dCDN to send a FCI capability type object to a uCDN.  This
   draft adds an object named FCI.SupportedDelegationMethods.

   This object shall allow a dCDN to advertise the capabilities
   regarding the supported delegation methods and their configuration.

   The following is an example of the supported delegated methods
   capability object for a CDN supporting STAR delegation method.

   {
     "capabilities": [
       {
         "capability-type": "FCI.SupportedDelegationMethods",
         "capability-value": {
           "delegation-methods": [
             "AcmeStarDelegationDelegationMethod",
             "... Other supported delegation methods ..."
           ]
         },
         "footprints": [
           "Footprint objects"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

3.   Delegation metadata for CDNI

   This section defines Delegation metadata using the current Metadata
   interface model.  This allows bootstrapping delegation methods
   between a uCDN and a delegate dCDN.

3.1.  Usage example related to an HostMatch object

   This section presents the use of CDNI Delegation metadata to apply to
   an HostMatch object, as defined in [RFC8006] and as specified in the
   following sections.

   The existence of delegation method in the CDNI metadata Object shall
   enable the use of this method, as chosen by the delegating entity.
   In the case of an HostMatch object, the delegation method will be
   activated for the set of Host defined in the HostMatch.  See
   Section 3.2 for more details about delegation methods metadata
   specification.

   The HostMatch object can reference a host metadata that points at the
   delegation information.  Delegation metadata are added to a Metadata
   object.

   Those "delegation" metadata can apply to other MI objects such as
   PathMatch object metadata.

   Below shows both HostMatch and its Metadata related to a host, for
   example, here is a HostMatch object referencing "video.example.com":

   HostMatch:
   {
     "host": "video.example.com",
     "host-metadata": {
       "type": "MI.HostMetadata",
       "href": "https://metadata.ucdn.example/host1234"
     }
   }

   Following the example above, the metadata is modeled for
   ACMEStarDelegationMethod as follows:

   {
     "generic-metadata-value": {
       "acme-delegations": [
         "https://acme.ucdn.example/acme/delegation/ogfr8EcolOT",
         "https://acme.ucdn.example/acme/delegation/wSi5Lbb61E4"
       ]
     }
   }

3.2.  AcmeStarDelegationMethod object

   This section defines the AcmeStarDelegationMethod object which
   describes metadata related to the use of ACME/STAR API presented in
   [RFC9115].

   As expressed in [RFC9115], when an origin has set a delegation to a
   specific domain (i.e. dCDN), the dCDN should present to the end-user
   client, a short-term certificate bound to the master certificate.
